# Weather App

A dynamic, responsive web application that provides real-time weather information for any city worldwide. Developed as part of my web development journey, this project demonstrates the use of modern front-end technologies and integration with third-party APIs to deliver live weather data and an engaging user experience.

## 📖 Project Description

The Weather App enables users to search for current weather conditions by entering a city name. It fetches live weather data from a public Weather API and displays essential information including temperature, weather conditions, humidity, wind speed, and weather icons to visually represent conditions.

Key objectives of this project:

- Enhance practical skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Learn how to integrate and consume external APIs using asynchronous JavaScript (fetch).
- Build a responsive and visually appealing UI.
- Practice error handling for invalid user inputs or API issues.
- Strengthen understanding of DOM manipulation and dynamic content rendering.

This application is designed for educational purposes and simulates the core features seen in professional weather applications.
